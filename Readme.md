# Database Test

* config from [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config)
* database from [sequilize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)
* [manual migration](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/migrations.html)
* [programatic migration](https://github.com/sequelize/umzug) - unused



## Setup

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=development node node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```

# Knex.js version

After becoming dissatisfied with the state of the documentation with Sequelize 
V4, all the docs only refer to V3, and the migration stuff is all  V3 specific. 
I've decided to look at Knex

* [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org)
* [Bookshelf.js](http://bookshelfjs.org/)
* [Objection.js](http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)
